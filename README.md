Feedback submission and viewing application

This project is a SPA containing a form for students to submit feedback about their course to the course representatives
Once feedback is submitted it is saved to local storage allowing it to be accessed after the page is closed
It also contains a tool allowing course representatives to view and delete feedback submitted about the course, allowing them to remove feedback submissions that have been sorted
Feedback can only be viewed by course representatives and this is enforced with a sign in system

As only specific people are able to sign in there is no account creation function. To sign in please use one of the following logins
1: Username:Account1, Password:password1
2: Username:Account2, Password:password2
3: Username:Account3, Password:password2

The project contains the following html files
oldhtmlversion.html : Old version of html code
prototype.html : old version of code which matches prototype seen in interim video
maincode.html: Most up to date version of html code(completed code)

The project contains the following javascript file
JsForCw1004.js : contains all the javascript functions used for the project

While my project does not contain JSON files within the repository, JSON files are used. This was done in the form of local storage. Upon first loading up the project a set of 6 example feedback submissions will be loaded and stored in JSON in local storage.

The project also contains a folder of diagrams,mostly consisting of UML diagrams but also containing class diagrams,use case diagrams, website diagrams and more 

There is also 3 files for the poster used in this project,the first is Poster draft.pub, a publisher file on which the initial draft of the poster was made, the second is Poster fianal.pub which was the final file used for making the poster and the third was PosterFinal(completed).png,which is the finished poster in png format 
Other than the code,mostly everything seen in this repository is also seen in some form in the design document, but for convenience in case I needed the files later I kept them stored with the repository

To run the application you can either open the Code folder in VScode or open the html file
