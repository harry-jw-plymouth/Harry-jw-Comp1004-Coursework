Feedback submission and viewing application

This project is a SPA containing a form for students to submit feedback about their course to the course representatives
Once feedback is submitted it is saved to local storage allowing it to be accessed after the page is closed
It also contains a tool allowing course representatives to view and delete feedback submitted about the course, allowing them to remove feedback submissions that have been sorted
Feedback can only be viewed by course representatives and this is enforced with a sign in system
